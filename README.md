# Santa Versus Birds

## Description

**Santa Versus Birds** puts you in the role of the one and only hero of the world: **Santa Claus**.

Rescue ten dwarven cities under attack by two species of birds threatening their small houses. With Rudolph’s help, Santa must shoot down enemies using an endless supply of coal—while still delivering presents to those in need.

This release is a short, experimental experience: a twelve-second minigame that loops ten times. There is no traditional level design; everything is randomized. Feedback on the gameplay loop is welcome, as a story-driven sequel is planned.
